It is important that you have NewtonVR installed, if you do not have it installed the scripts that come with the pack will throw an error. If you do not want to use NewtonVR and get rid of the error simply delete the script and write your own.

For any questions of custom changes feel free to contact us at info@sakarigames.com

All the best!
